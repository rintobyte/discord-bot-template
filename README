# rintabyte's discord.js bot template

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Create a file called `.env`. Then add the line `DISCORD_TOKEN="{token}"`, replacing token with your bots token
3. Edit the `config.json` file (guildId should be set to the guild to register (/) commands to, clientId is just the bot's id)
4. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies

## Deployment
1. Run `node .\deploy-commands.js` to register (/) or update them
   This must be run whenever you update the data property of a (/) command
2. Run your bot with `node .`
